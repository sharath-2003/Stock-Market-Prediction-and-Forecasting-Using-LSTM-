The primary objective of this project is to utilize Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network models to forecast
Stock Price Prediction.
The Stacked LSTM model is built using the Keras library with TensorFlow backend. It consists of three LSTM layers
with 50 units each, followed by a Dense output layer. The model is trained on the training data for 10 epochs using the
Adam optimizer.
